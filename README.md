## Installation

The CLI can be installed and updated by running `pip install --upgrade lean`.

Note that many commands in the CLI require Docker to run. See [Get Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) for instructions on how to install Docker for your operating system.

After installing the CLI, open a terminal in an empty directory and run `lean init`. This command downloads the latest configuration file and sample data from the [QuantConnect/Lean](https://github.com/QuantConnect/Lean) repository. We recommend running all Lean CLI commands in the same directory `lean init` was ran in.

## Usage

The Lean CLI supports multiple workflows. The examples below serve as a starting point, you're free to mix local and cloud features in any way you'd like.

A cloud-focused workflow (local development, cloud execution) with the CLI may look like this:
1. Open a terminal in the directory you ran `lean init` in.
2. Run `lean cloud pull` to pull remotely changed files.
3. Start programming locally and run backtests in the cloud with `lean cloud backtest "Project Name" --open --push` whenever there is something to backtest. The `--open` flag means that the backtest results will be opened in the browser when done, while the `--push` flag means that local changes are pushed to the cloud before running the backtest.
4. Whenever you want to create a new project, run `lean create-project "Project Name"` and `lean cloud push --project "Project Name"` to create a new project containing some basic code and to push it to the cloud.
5. When you're finished for the moment, run `lean cloud push` to push all locally changed files to the cloud.

A locally-focused workflow (local development, local execution) with the CLI may look like this:
1. Open a terminal in the directory you ran `lean init` in.
2. Run `lean create-project "Project Name"` to create a new project with some basic code to get you started.
3. Work on your strategy in `./Project Name`.
4. Run `lean research "Project Name"` to start a Jupyter Lab session to perform research in.
5. Run `lean backtest "Project Name"` to run a backtest whenever there's something to test. This runs your strategy in a Docker container containing the same packages as the ones used on QuantConnect.com, but with your own data.

  --image TEXT        The LEAN research image to use (defaults to quantconnect/research:latest)
  --update            Pull the LEAN research image before starting the research environment
  --lean-config FILE  The Lean configuration file that should be used (defaults to the nearest lean.json)

## Development

To work on the Lean CLI, clone the repository, enter an environment containing Python 3.6+ and run `pip install -r requirements.txt`. This command will install the required dependencies and installs the CLI in editable mode. This means you'll be able to edit the code and immediately see the results the next time you run `lean`.

If you need to add dependencies, first update `setup.py` (if it is a production dependency) or `requirements.txt` (if it is a development dependency) and then re-run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

The automated tests can be ran by running `pytest`. The filesystem and HTTP requests are mocked when running tests to make sure they run in an isolated environment.

To update the commands reference part of the readme run `python scripts/readme.py` from the root of the project.

Maintainers can publish new releases by pushing a Git tag containing the new version to GitHub. This will trigger a GitHub Actions workflow which releases the current `master` branch to PyPI with the value of the tag as version. Make sure the version is not prefixed with "v".
